# NGDB-Project
This project is about Sports platform for NITT students
We will take the student data of first years and already studying students and sports they are intrested in .
I will store the data in MYSQl using php . and retrive the results according to the student required sport.
To execute the code keep the files in Xaamp->htdocs->NGDB and execute it.
As per Janet mam suggestion I think GRAPHDB will be suitable for my problem .
I am working on it.
